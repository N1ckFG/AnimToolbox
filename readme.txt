FEATURES:

I.  BASIC
1. Nulls for Pins (layer selection): Creates a controller null for each puppet pin on a layer. 
2. Parent Chain (layer selection): Parent a chain of layers one to another.
3. Locator Null...
     (layer selection): Creates a new null at the location of each selected layer.
     (no selection): Creates a new null in the center of the comp. 
4. Move to Position (layer selection): Moves all layers to the location of the last selected layer.
5. Bake Keyframes (layer selection): Bakes expressions and puppet pins to keyframes.
6. Make Loop...
     (layer selection): Puts a cycle expression on Time Remap.
     (property selection): Puts a cycle expression on the selected properties.
7. Crossfader (comp selection): Fades a layer into a duplicate of itself for a seamless loop.
8. Onion Skin (no selection): Creates an adjustment layer that applies an onion skin effect.

II.  RIGGING
1. Blink Control (comp selection): Turns a blink layer inside the comp on and off.  
2. Jaw Rig Side (comp selection): Rigs a jaw layer inside the comp for audio control of rotation.
3. Jaw Rig Front (comp selection): Rigs a jaw layer inside the comp for audio control of position.
4. Snake Rig (layer selection): Rigs a puppet-pin layer for automated snake-like movement.
5. Beam Rig (no selection): Creates a 3D laser effect with start and end nulls.
6. Particle Rig (no selection): Creates a null controller for Particular particles.
7. Camera Rig (no selection): Creates a camera rigged for point-of-interest and DoF control. 
8. Graph Audio (layer selection): Converts audio to keyframes and enables the graph view.

III.  ADVANCED
1. Lock Y Rotation (layer selection): Forces a layer to always face the camera.
2. Auto Z Rotation (layer selection): Smart 2D auto-rotation.
3. Parentable Null (layer selection): Creates a null with expressions that solve certain parenting problems. 
4. 3D MoSketch (no selection): Creates a null with 3D controls for use with Motion Sketch.
5. Sine Generator (layer selection): Applies sine-wave motion controls to a layer.  
6. Split s3D Pair (layer selection): Splits a stereo 3D pair video into two left and right comps.
7. Merge s3D Pair (layer selection): Merges two left and right comps into a stereo 3D pair comp.
8. s3D Dispmap...
     (one layer selected): Creates an s3D pair from the selected layer, using it as a displacement map.
     (two layers selected): Creates an s3D pair from the first layer, using the second layer for displacement.
